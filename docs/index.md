# Mini Numbers Documentation

**Mini Numbers** is a privacy-first, self-hosted web analytics platform. It gives you the website traffic insights you need — without compromising your visitors' privacy.

Think of it as a simpler, privacy-respecting alternative to Google Analytics that you run on your own server.

## What makes it different?

- **No cookies** — Your visitors won't see consent banners because of your analytics
- **No personal data stored** — IP addresses are never saved to disk
- **Tiny tracker** — The script added to your website is only 1.3KB (smaller than most images)
- **Self-hosted** — Your data stays on your server, under your control
- **Open source** — Free to use, modify, and share under the MIT license

## What can you track?

- **Page views** — See which pages get the most traffic
- **Visitors** — Count unique visitors without identifying them
- **Referrers** — Know where your traffic comes from
- **Geography** — See which countries and cities your visitors are in
- **Devices** — Desktop vs. mobile vs. tablet breakdown
- **Custom events** — Track button clicks, signups, purchases, or any action
